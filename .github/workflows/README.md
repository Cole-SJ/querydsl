## Why do you have a strict issue-closing policy?

I understand this may seem strict, but here's why: I can't realistically review every issue that gets raised. However, I do make sure to review and engage with all pull requests.

If something is important enough, the person raising it will likely create a pull request to address it. 

On the other hand, if the issue is only important for others to work on, it can end up creating unnecessary noise and might hide issues that people are genuinely willing to tackle.
